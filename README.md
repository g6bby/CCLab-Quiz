# DESIGN PROCESS

I took a more methodical approach this time, first starting with basic HTML/Javascript and later adding CSS to customize the website. I did find it rather difficult to use CSS with buttons, trying to create a different shape and make the quiz appear less "default" like. It also was challenging to learn about different buttons such as "radio", and how I could alter the outcome of the quiz based on which options were selected.

# INSPIRATION AND REFERENCES

Most of my inspiration comes from quizzes you take to find out something about yourself, such as a personality test or the Hogwarts House test. I wanted to bring a sort of satisfaction of taking the quiz, where the user then knows something about themselves as if their choices has influenced the outcome.

# CHALLENGES I FACED

Although I am not entirely familiar with Javascript, I definitely found myself much more comfortable with it this time around. I think the previous projects taught me a lot about what to expect and how I could be more intentional with how I was laying out the quiz and website as a whole.

# NEXT STEPS FOR THE PROJECT

If I had more time, I would want to add more questions and a variety of characters for the results of the quiz. I would try to create a theme for the page, and possibly play with the CSS elements more. I feel as though right now the quiz is pretty plain in terms of decoration, but as a second version maybe I could play with that idea. As for the content of the quiz, it would be interesting to make the questions a bit different like asking about specfic ingredients or meals, or how these food items affect someones life in a different way.
